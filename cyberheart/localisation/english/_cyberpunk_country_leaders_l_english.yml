 NSA_rosalind_myers_desc:0 "§tThe NUSA calls for the states to unite. Unity is strength, division is weakness.§!\n\nRosalind Myer's challenging upbringing forged a unique blend of creativity and aloofness within her character. Seeking to break free from her harsh beginnings, she opted to enlist in the Militech Marines, finding solace in the camaraderie of her newfound family. Through steadfast determination, she ascended the ranks, eventually securing a prominent role alongside Militech's CEO, Donald Lundee. Following Lundee's passing, Myer assumed the mantle of CEO herself, orchestrating her transition from military leadership to corporate command.\n\nSubsequently, in 2067, she assumed a more expansive role, succeeding Elizabeth Kress as the President of the NUSA, a pivotal shift from her prior role at Militech. With a vision akin to Kress's, Rosalind looked towards the Western horizon, aiming to unite the NUSA with the independent Western territories. This aspiration reflected her strategic approach to leadership, demonstrating her commitment toward forging a united country."
